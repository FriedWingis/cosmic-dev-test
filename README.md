## Project Overview

StarForging is a Minecraft plugin designed for Java 1.21.3 that introduces a unique system where players can gain traits that enhance their gameplay, combat mechanics, and exploration skills. These traits are applied through armor pieces and offer exciting abilities like teleportation, increased damage, and defensive boosts.

## What Inspired This Project?

Coming from my experience on CosmicPvP, CosmicSky, and other OP PvP servers, I fell in love with the PvP style that features special buffs. I wanted to create a late-game system that would provide players with dynamic and rewarding traits, making the progression feel more personalized and exciting as they advanceâ€”especially by tying StarDust earnings to crop farming, one of the core mechanics from CosmicSky.

## How to Get Started In-Game

1. **Farm Crops**: I've implemented the current crop shop items from CosmicSky. The more expensive the crop is on CosmicSky, the more likely StarDust is to drop.
2. **Collect StarDust**: Gather 48 StarDust for Diamond armor and 64 for Netherite armor.
3. **Gather Armor**: Choose a suitable piece of armor to upgrade.
4. **Visit the /celestialforge**: Here, you can insert your armor and the required StarDust.
5. **Click the Green Pane**: This will imbue your item with a special trait.
6. **Enjoy Your New Powers!**: Use your newly imbued item and experience enhanced abilities.
